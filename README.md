# Important Announcement

Create presentations the in similar to the Victorian Governments coronavirus announcement messages.

### [Create a presentation](https://important-message.netlify.app/)

Made with hackily and hastily while learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

## Deploy

Deployed with Github actions to [Netlify](https://important-message.netlify.app/).
